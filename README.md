# Infant-Cry-Classification-using-python
 
Poster presentation of one of the research work. Soon, I'll submit the paper. ðŸ¤²
I made a Deep Learning model which can classify the type of infant's cry. It will help doctors and parents to diagnose any possible disease related to infants. So I call this "Cries to Answers" model.
This work is the outcome of my Masterâ€™s Research Methodology course work.
